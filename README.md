PREDICTING MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS ANALYSIS DASHBOARD

ABSTRACT 

   The rise of mental health concerns in the modern workplace, particularly within high-
pressure environments such as the tech industry, has brought attention to the urgent need for
predictive tools to identify individuals at risk of mental health crises. This project aims to
develop a comprehensive approach to predicting mental health crises using the
Mental Health in Tech Survey dataset. The dataset includes variables such as employee
demographics, workplace culture, family history of mental illness, and access to mental
health resources, offering valuable insights into factors that contribute to mental health
disorders in the tech sector. The primary objective of this research is to leverage statistical
and visual analysis techniques to identify patterns and trends that can help predict potential
mental health crises. By examining both individual and organizational factors, the project
seeks to provide a holistic understanding of the conditions that may lead employees to
experience mental health challenges. This includes assessing the role of company size, the
availability of mental health benefits, openness to discussing mental health issues at work,
and the impact of familial predispositions on workplace performance and well-being. A series
of interactive charts and graphs were created using Power BI to visualize key trends, such as
the distribution of mental health treatment by company size, the ease of obtaining mental
health leave by country, and the relationship between gender and treatment-seeking
behaviour. These visualizations were integrated into an interactive dashboard designed to
provide a clear, user-friendly view of the mental health landscape within tech workplaces.
This dashboard allows for real-time exploration of the data, enabling stakeholders to identify
at-risk populations and tailor mental health interventions accordingly. By utilizing Power BI's
interactive capabilities, this project not only provides a clear snapshot of the current state of
mental health in tech but also serves as a tool for ongoing monitoring and improvement. The
dashboard's dynamic nature enables it to be updated with new data over time, ensuring its
relevance for future analyses and decision-making processes.
